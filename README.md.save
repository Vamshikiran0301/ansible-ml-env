#  Ansible-Automated ML Experimentation Environment

This project automates the setup of a machine learning experimentation environment using **Ansible** and **WSL2 Ubuntu** on Windows. It installs essential ML tools such as **TensorFlow**, **PyTorch**, **Jupyter Notebook**, and **MLflow** — all inside a Python virtual environment.

> ⚙️ Designed for data scientists, MLOps engineers, and students who want a one-command setup for local ML experimentation.

##  What's Automated

- ✅ System dependencies
- ✅ Python virtual environment
- ✅ ML packages: TensorFlow, PyTorch, Jupyter, MLflow
- ✅ Jupyter Notebook (localhost:8888)
- ✅ MLflow Tracking UI (localhost:5000)

## Quick Start

```bash
ansible-playbook -i ansible/inventory.ini ansible/playbook.yml --ask-become-pass
